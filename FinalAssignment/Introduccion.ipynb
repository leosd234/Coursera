Being a brick and mortar store based out Vinings, Atlanta it is vital to keep costs down to ensure sufficient cash flow. Their primary suppliers and vendors are based out of New York and the uneven lockdowns have disrupted their supply chain\r\n",

        "Unfortunately the store fell victim to ongoing unrest and incurred significant damage due to rioting and looting. The management has hereby decided to move the store to New York City due following reasons:\r\n",
        "### 1. Lack of timely state aid to deal with damage\r\n",
        "### 2. Closer to suppliers helps to reduce shipping costs\r\n",
        "### 3. Current lease is about to expire\r\n",
        "The store is quite popular among older demographic with families who have high household Income. They have also launched a new brand to attract Millenials and is just getting noticed and are scouting locations in New York City to find ideal location to establish their store.
